* Gantoo

A Gentoo glibc/musl based container image to dynamically/statically build Common Lisp applications.

Pushed to [[https://hub.docker.com/r/molochwalker/gantoo/tags][Docker Hub]]

** Why?
   - Alpine sometimes has missing static libraries (.a)
   - Alpine sometimes dynamically link their libraries a little too much (ex: imagemagick with X11)
   - Alpine sometimes has some packages missing (sometimes for a good reason but...)
   - If possible I don't want to write custom build scripts for each new library I use
** Dev Notes
   - Portage not included in the image. You will need to *emerge-webrsync* (might be with the snapshot date of the build, see Dockerfile)
   - VIDEO_CARDS= set to empty to skip driver compilation
   - using an actions/cache fork to save cache (binpkgs) even on failure
   - Faked ID=alpine on /etc/os-release to make github action runner happy and use a musl based "node" image
